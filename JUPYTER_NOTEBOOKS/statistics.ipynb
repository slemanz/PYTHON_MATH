    "The mean is a common and intuitive way to summarize a set of numbers. It’s what we might simply call the __“average”__ in everyday use, although as we’ll see, there are other kinds of averages as well. Let’s take a sample set of numbers and calculate the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll write a program that calculates and prints the mean for a collection of numbers. To calculate the mean, we’ll need to take the sum of the list of numbers and divide it by the number of items in the list. We have two Python functions that make both of these operations very easy: sum() and len(). So our code will look like:"

If the length of the list of numbers is odd, the number in the middle of the list is the median. If the length of the list of numbers is even, we get the median by taking the mean of the two middle numbers. Let’s find the median of the previous list of donations (assume, just for this example that we have another donation total for the 13th).\n",
