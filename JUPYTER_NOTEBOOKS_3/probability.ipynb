    "- __Experiment__ is simply the test we want to perform. We perform the test because we’re interested in the probability of each possible outcome. Rolling a die, flipping a coin, and pulling a card from a deck of cards are all examples of experiments. A single run of an experiment is referred to as a trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Sample space__ all possible outcomes of an experiment form a set known as the _sample space_, which we’ll usually call $S$ in formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Event__ is a set of outcomes that we want to calculate the probability of and that form a subset of the sample space. For example, we might want to know the probability of a particular outcome, like rolling a 3, or the probability of a set of multiple outcomes, such as rolling an even number (either 2, 4, or 6). We’ll use the letter E in formulas.\n",
